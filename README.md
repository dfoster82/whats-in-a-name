# What’s in a Name? Analysis of Data Science Job Titles and Skill Sets in the United States

## Notebook Entry for 2021 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey Competition

What makes a data scientist a data scientist? Or a data analyst a data analyst? Just like with the term “big data,” there are many definitions of these roles. The field of data science and machine learning continues to grow and evolve, and so do the job titles (and job responsibilities) for these fields.

Because the field of data science is still relatively new and continues to grow, there is no general consensus on how to define the many interrelated roles in the industry. Responsibilities tend to overlap, particularly in smaller companies where there may not be a dedicated data team. The term “data scientist” is still so new that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2021) does not list a category for this role—data scientists and data analysts would likely fall within the category of Database Administrators and Architects, and related categories include Computer Programmers and Computer and Information Research Scientists.

The analysis in this notebook aims to provide a comprehensive overview of job titles and job responsibilities within the U.S. data science field. It examines demographic information such as age, gender, and levels of education as well as technology use and participants’ salaries and years of experience.
